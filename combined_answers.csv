For students the ultimate vision is to, um, be sure that they are information independent in a sense that they are able to find the information that they need to make critical judgements about what they do find and then to be able to use the information for the purpose of solving an intellectual career or personal problem. So that's, that's, that's our end-game. That's what we really want to do. I'm sorry, and then for the faculty we want to, um, help them be successful at the teaching and research and publication."
